This table summarizes the STAR alignments, including the number of input reads, unique reads (reads mapped to only one genomic location), multi-reads (reads mapped to multiple genomic locations), and unmapped reads (reads not mapped to any genomic locations (e.g. too many mismatches, too short, etc.), reads mapped to too many genomic locations, and chimeric reads). The corresponding percentages are also calculated.
